# Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way (by Will Kurt)
(selected exercises from or related to or inspired by)

NOTE: I do not have a background in statistics. This is a learning project for me. It is also a chance to dabble in R, and explore that ecosystem. If anyone finds an error then please correct me. If anyone finds these of value then please enjoy.
